# ATTENTION

# Transition config settings

# ReadConsistency is the consistency of the plot package
# WriteConsistency is the consistency of the collector package

# The keyspace package still uses the cassandraAdmin consistency
# and the udpError package still uses the cassandra consistency
# The idea is to change the cassandra gobol package to accept
# multiple consistencies and abstract that to the applications

# MaxConcurrentTimeseries CANNOT BE BIGGER THAN MaxConcurrentReads
# Max number of concurrent timeseries being processed
MaxConcurrentTimeseries = 50

# Max number of concurrent read queries on cassandra

# Max number of timeseries allowed to be queried
MaxTimeseries = 5000

# Warning number of timeseries
LogQueryTSthreshold = 1000

# Max number of concurrent points being processed
MaxConcurrentPoints = 1000

# Max number of concurrent bulk requests to elasticsearch
MaxConcurrentBulks = 1

# Number, in bytes of bulk playload
MaxMetaBulkSize = 1000000

# Number of points in buffer
